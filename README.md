# The Learning Game - MIS 426

This is an assignment for my MIS 426 course, a course taught at Oakland University.
We covered how to use GameMaker Studio in this course.

## Installation

Run the game in GameMaker 1.4. Not really a playable game, but this does things though. 

## The Assignment 
Taken from https://gm.cybercour.se/course/fleet-builder: 
"There are five spaceships, plus some working images I added just in case. Each image is 124 px wide. Suppose we have a row of five randomly chosen ships, with 10px on the left and right of the row, and 10px between each ship. (124+10)px is the width of a ship, plus 10px on its right. Five of those. Then we just need another 10 px on the left of the first ship. If you don’t see how that works, draw it out.
Start a new GM project with a room that’s 680px wide. How high? 598px. That’s enough space for a ship area with four rows of ships with 10px on the top and bottom, and 10px between, plus two 25px areas above and below the ship area for goals, and scoring.
Use tiles from the zip file, or whatever, to put backgrounds on the three areas. Change the room dimensions, the tiles, the sprites, whatevs.
Make the rest of the rows. They fall, and fill in the ship area."
